---------------------------------------------
Concurrency-safe per-organization per-document-type numbering.

Replaces the old count()-based numbering (count of rows + 1), which could
produce duplicate numbers under concurrency and after voiding/soft-deleting
documents. Every next_number() call locks the sequence row with SELECT FOR
UPDATE, so concurrent issuers are serialized and can never observe the same
last_number.

Each org has one row per doc_type. When the sequence reset window (monthly /
quarterly / annual) rolls over, last_number restarts at 1.
