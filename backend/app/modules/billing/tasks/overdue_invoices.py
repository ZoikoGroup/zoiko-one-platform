"""
billing/tasks/overdue_invoices.py
----------------------------------
Automatic overdue-invoice detection job.

InvoiceService.mark_overdue() has existed since the invoice lifecycle was
built (SENT/PARTIALLY_PAID -> OVERDUE is an already-validated transition in
InvoiceService._validate_status_transition), but nothing ever called it —
invoices could never reach OVERDUE, which meant the dunning/collections
engines could never find anything to act on. This job is the missing caller;
it does not add any new dunning/collections behaviour.

Runs on a configurable interval (default: every hour), mirroring
tasks/recurring_billing.py.
Processes ALL organisations in a single pass.
Each invoice is processed independently — failures are isolated.
